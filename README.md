# Code-for-AD-Dataloading-
This code containing some of the modules for data loading as part of AD detection 
Below is my project decription for detail.



Problem statement:
Our aim is to improve upon the existing model for the detection and classification of
Alzheimer’s diseases based on MRI images and clinical features. The framework is based on
deep learning for multi-Class Alzheimer’s disease detection using Brain MRI Data and clinical data.
Identify different stages of Alzheimer Disease (AD, MCI, LMCI and NP) in single run and enhanc
e the efficiency on large dataset and remove the class imbalance problem of existing models.
